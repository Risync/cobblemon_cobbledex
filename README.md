# Cobblemon Cobbledex

## Python Script for Tracking Cobblemon in Minecraft

Python script that uses the minescript library to send you to the https://pokemondb.net/ page for the cobblemon you are looking at, upon pressing a specified key.

### Features
   
1. **Written Guide**: Call the function by pressing the specified key while looking at the pokemon (default key is 'ctrl', this can be edited using a text editor)

2. **Functionality**: Once a request is made, you will be redirected to the pokemon database for the cobblemon you are looking at, it does this by taking the cobblemons entity information and then retrieving the name from it. The name then gets joined with the link from the pokemon database to send you to the specific pokemon's page.
